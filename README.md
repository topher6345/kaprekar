# Kaprekar

A gem to explore [Kaprekar's routine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number))

kaprekar 1234

Kaprekar discovered the Kaprekar constant or `6174` in 1949.[4] He showed that `6174` is reached in the limit as one repeatedly subtracts the highest and lowest numbers that can be constructed from a set of four digits that are not all identical. Thus, starting with 1234, we have

```
4321 − 1234 = 3087, then
8730 − 0378 = 8352, and
8532 − 2358 = 6174.
```

Repeating from this point onward leaves the same number (7641 − 1467 = 6174). In general, when the operation converges it does so in at most seven iterations.


Kaprekar was a schoolteacher and a recreactional mathemetician.
